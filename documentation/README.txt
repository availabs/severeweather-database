Contained in the files linked to these pages are the raw Storm Data csv (comma separated values) files as downloaded from the NWS.
 
File names contain the date range or month for the data within the file.
 
There are 3 files for each month:

Also, the entire Storm Events Database is available in Microsoft Access 2000/2003 format:
