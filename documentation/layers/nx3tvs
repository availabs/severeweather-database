NEXRAD Level III Data Products
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Info
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  The National Weather Service (NWS) Doppler (NEXRAD) radar system estimates the 
intensity, position, velocity, and type of moisture in the atmosphere. Each radar 
site includes equipment and software that searches this basic precipitation data 
for patterns that estimate the presence (or likelyhood thereof) of various kinds 
of severe weather events. The datasets derived from this processing are called 
"NEXRAD Level III" products. SWDI currently provides access to the following 5 
such products: 
   1) Hail Index Overlay (HI) - A product designed to locate storms which have 
      the potential to produce hail.
      
   2) Mesocyclone Overlay (M) - This legacy product is designed to display information 
      regarding the existence and nature of rotations associated with thunderstorms. 
      Numerical output includes azimuth, range, and height of the mesocyclone.
      
   3) Storm Structure (SS) - A product designed to display information on storm 
      attributes which include maximum reflectivity, maximum velocity at lowest 
      elevation angle, storm overhang, mass weighted storm volume, storm area 
      base and top, storm position and storm tilt.
      
   4) Tornadic Vortex Signature Overlay (TVS) - A product which shows an intense 
      gate to gate azimuthal shear associated with tornadic-scale rotation.
      
   5) Digital Mesocyclone Detection Algorithm (MD) - This product is the 
      sucessor to the legacy Mesocyclone (M) product and is designed to display information 
      regarding the existence and nature of rotations associated with thunderstorms. 
      Numerical output includes azimuth, range, and height of the mesocyclone.

  Accuracy
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  These NEXRAD Level III products (HI, M, SS, TVS) contain several possible sources 
of inaccuracies.  The spatial accuracy of the data decreases with the range from 
the source NEXRAD Radar site.  The general spatial accuracy of these data is 1 deg 
(theta) by 1 km (r), in the polar coordinate system centered on the Radar site where 
'theta' is the angle from North and 'r' is the distance from the Radar site.  This 
1 deg x 1 km spacing equates to a range of spatial accuracies from 1 km (near Radar 
site) to 4 km (at 230 km from Radar site).

  Other factors contribute to the accuracy of these products and algorithms.  The 
algorithms often rely on several different 'sweeps' at different elevation angles 
to determine hail, rotation, etc...  Fewer sweeps are available at far distances from 
the NEXRAD site, resulting in less input data to the algorithm and possibly less 
accurate results.  Mountainous areas can cause beam blockage at lower elevation 
angles, which compounds these issues.  Furthermore, there are many adaptable 
parameters set by the Radar operator which are adjusted and 'tuned' for each weather 
situation or season.  Variation of these values can cause additional inconsistencies.  
    
  Even with these accuracy issues, the dataset is helpful in finding areas of bad 
weather and can be used in combination with other datasets (such as verified Storm 
Events) to add confidence to the values.
